# Naming of DB Node/Edge Collections and API functions

Generally collections are named with underscores (snake_case) and API functions with dashes (according to Search Engine Optimization).


## Node Collections:
Nodes are to be named according to their content (plural).
For example: genes, proteins, transcripts, variants, ontological_terms, regulatory_regions


## Edge Collections
Edges are to be named according to the parent-child relationship that they contain (singular).

Example: ontological_term_ontologocal_term or variant_gene



### Motifs - maybe separate collecltion.
