In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467, and SMAD3 on Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighbouring R-Smad subunits.

The DNA recognition sequence depends on the composition of the bZIP dimer with the complex either binding to the preferred region of one of the partners or to a novel bZIP cognate site.	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.

Catalytic component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres. Acts as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA-dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6-nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension.

Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of atrial natriuretic peptide ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases. The end result is a reduction in blood volume and, therefore, a reduction in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.	The ANPR-A dimer complex is composed of two ANPR-A molecules. The ANPR-A monomer has a membrane-distal and a membrane-proximal domain, each consisting of a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices. The ANPR-A monomers form a head-to-head dimer through their membrane distal domains. The membrane-distal domains also bind chloride ions, necessary for ANP binding. ANP binding induces structural changes to the ANPR-A dimer. These involve a shift of the relative positions of the two ANPR-A monomers. This brings two active sites of the GCase domains to optimal proximity and orientation, thereby giving rise to the GCase catalytic activity.

Cardiac PLN is a main determinant of muscle contraction and relaxation. In the unphosphorylated form PLN inhibits the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a membrane protein responsible for the pumping most of the calcium from the cytoplasm to the SR, thereby causing a relaxation of myofibrils.	The cardiac PLN homopentamer is a 30-kDa complex composed of 5 PLN monomers. Each of the monomers consists of a short, positively charged amphipathic (AP) alpha-helix, an extended linker and a long TM alpha-helix. PLN pentamer forms an unusual bell flower-like assembly held together by leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs along the membrane-spanning helices. The structure has some unexpected features, such as a strong curvature of the TM helix and an axial orientation of the AP helix.

The NKX-2.5 homodimer complex is composed of two NKX-2.5 molecules interacting possibly at the C-terminus of their homeobox domains (HD). Lys-193 and Arg-194 located at the HD C-terminus are essential residues for homodimerization.

The extensive interactions between the two proteins indicate that Telethonin provides a 'bridge' that anchors the ends of two different Titin molecules to the Z disk. There is evidence that Telethonin binding to Titin might be essential for the initial assembly, stabilization and functional integrity of the Titin filament and hence important for muscle contraction relaxation in mature myofibrils.	The N-terminus of Titin comprising of Z1 and Z2 IgG-like domains is assembled into an antiparallel sandwich complex with the titin-binding domain of telethonin with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Telethonin has a pseudosymmetric structure which mediates a palindromic arrangement of two Titin filaments. This arrangement is unique, previously found only in palindromic or pseudopalindromic protein-DNA complexes. Structural and binding evidence suggests that telethonin might act as a Titin-Titin crosslinker, indicating the binding is very tight. It is believed that the Titin N-terminus-Telethonin complex forms a core that interacts with several ligands both inside and outside the sarcomeric Z disk, including MLP, sAnkyrin, the beta subunit of the minK potassium channel , gamma-filamin/ABP-L, alpha actinin and the telethonin binding protein of the Z disk (FATZ).

By cross-linking and anchoring actin filaments, filamins stabilize the plasma membrane, provide cellular cortical rigidity, and contribute to the mechanical stability of the plasma membrane and the cell cortex. FLNa-actin networks behave as weak elastic solids under low shear stress due to the flexible nature of actin-FLNa crosslinks, yet can support large shear stresses and have pronounced nonlinear strain-stiffening behaviors. High avidity binding to F-actin due to dimerization and multiple binding to F-actin through FLNa ABD and rod 1 confers strain-stiffening on actin networks. FLNa dimers also interact with transmembrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and intracellular signaling proteins and are therefore involved in stabilization and regulation of plasma membrane and intracellular signaling.

Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. 	The alpha subunit contains the Na+, K+ and ATP binding sites. The beta subunit is required for routing of the alpha subunit to the plasma membrane and for occlusion of the K+ ions. The gamma subunit regulates the pumping activity in a tissue- and isoform-specific way. Occlusion of K+ is vital for the stability of the complex.

Consequently, a reduction in the internalisation of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) occurs, leading to high plasma levels of LDLs, causing familial hypercholesterolemia type 3. Formation of the complex interferes with an acid-dependent conformational change of LDLR required for receptor recycling via the endosome. Instead, PCSK9 binding to LDLR can induce its ubiquitination leading to rerouteing of LDLR to the lysosome where it is degraded.	After auto-cleavage of PCSK9 at 152Gln, its pro-domain (Pro) remains tightly associated with its subtilisin-like catalytic domain (Cat) and both are bound to LDLR.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs) and used to treat diabetic disorders. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.	The complex exists in two conformations. In the quatrefoil form, KATP is a symmetrical tetramer; each protomer consists of one K+ channel subunit and one ABC transporter. The K+ channel consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain, which form the ion pathway through the complex. At the molecular center, the four subunits of Kir6.2 form a canonical inward-rectifier K+ channel structure. In the propeller form, the position of the transporter module changes relative to the molecular centre. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are approximately 4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.

Characterized by an excessive or uncontrolled insulin secretion and recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia requiring rapid and intensive treatment to prevent irreversible brain damage. Caused by loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11/Kir6.2 and/of ABCC8/SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic K+ channel resulting in either defects of K+ channel trafficking to the surface membrane or disruption of channel gating by nucleotides ultimately causing permanent activity of the voltage-gated calcium channel leading to permanent insulin secretion and hypoglycemia.|neonatal diabetes mellitus with reduced insulin secretion and resultant hyperglycemia [Orphanet:224]: Neonatal diabetes mellitus presents as hyperglycemia, delayed development of speech and walking and muscle weakness and, in some cases, dehydration and ketoacidosis which may be severe with coma, in a child within the first months of life. Includes Transient (TNDM) [Orphanet:99886] and Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) [Orphanet:99885]. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period, does not go into remission and requires continuous insulin treatment. The most extreme cases show Developmental delay-epilepsy-neonatal diabetes (DEND) [Orphanet:79134] syndrome, characterized by marked developmental delay, muscle weakness, epilepsy, dysmorphic feature, and neonatal diabetes, or Intermediate DEND syndrome (iDEND) [Orphanet:99989], a rare, mild form of DEND syndrome, characterised clinically by mild motor, speech or cognitive delay and an absence of epilepsy.

Required for the elongation of isolation membranes (phagophores). Acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein ATG3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome. ATG3 binds to and is activated by ATG12, facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation. The LC3 family is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide. Formation of the complex is mediated by ATG16L1 homo-oligomerization. Additionally ATG16L1 contains repeat WD40 domains, which facilitate the conjugation of LC3s to PE by recruiting other autophagic components onto the phagophore membrane and forming an approximately 800-kDa oligomeric complex, sedimentation studies suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for ATG16L1 to ATG12-ATG5. Several isoforms exist for ATG16L1 the distribution of which may be tissue-dependent. 	-	-	Associated with Crohn's Disease [EFO:0000384], a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, mostly found in the ileum, the cecum, and the colon.

Preferentially phosphorylates 'Ser-5' in CTD repeats that are already phosphorylated at 'Ser-7', but can also phosphorylate 'Ser-2'. Target of various anti-cancer drugs.	CDKs have a two-lobed structure. The amino-terminal lobe contains beta-sheets, the carboxy-terminal lobe is rich in alpha-helices, and the active site is sandwiched in-between. In the cyclin-free, monomeric form the CDK catalytic cleft is closed by a region known as the T-loop, preventing enzymatic activity. Cyclin binding leads to a conformational change, enabling activation of catalytic activity. Buried molecular surface area = 2294 A.The orientation of the cyclin with respect to the kinase differs by about 25 degrees compared to the cell cycle associated Cyclin-Cdk complexes.

Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron and ultimately producing muscle contractions. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction.	Consists of 5 subunits, 2x(alpha1), beta1, epsilon and delta subunits.alpha-epsilon and alpha-delta subunit interfaces form the ligand binding sites. The alpha subunit always supplies the ‘plus’-side of the ligand binding interface and determines ligand affinity whilst the other subunits supply the ‘minus’-binding side and determine ligand selectivity. The beta1 subunit can only occupy the 5th position and does not contribute to the ligand binding interfaces. Each subunit has four transmembrane domains and the transmembrane domains 2 line the channel influencing channel conductance and ion selectivity. Signal sequences guide cotranslational assembly in the ER membrane. Signal sequences guide cotranslational assembly in the ER membrane. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues during assembly influence cell-specific expression on the plasma membrane. N-linked, NH2-terminal glycosylation is required for insertion into the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic loop regulates assembly, expression and function. The subunits for theses receptors are highlyy conserved from rays to human but experimental evidence only exists from two ray species (CPX-2187 & CPX-2635). MW ~290 kD for pentamer.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel.

Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O95264(0)|P46098(0)

Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers.

Activated by simultaneous binding of glycine to GluN1 and L-glutamate to GluN2. Blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular magnesium which is released by membrane depolarization. Predominantly post-synaptic receptor that mediates mostly the late/slow phase of the majority of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain where it plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory acquisition and learning. Combinations of different receptor isoforms and their splice variants result in formation of ion channels with distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Replacement of one or more subunits with GluN3A (Q8TCU5) or GluN3B (O60391) subunits results in relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+. Dysfunctional NMDA receptors are implicated in various neurological disorders and injuries including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as neuronal loss following ischaemia or stroke.	Obligate heterotetramer formed around a central pore, with distinct domains that are arranged in parallel for all subunits. Topology of the N1/N2 units probably of 1-2-1-2 arrangement but some experiments suggest 1-1-2-2 arrangement. The GluN1 subunits occupy a proximal position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2/N3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind allosteric activators glycine or D-serine and GluN2 binds allosteric activators L-glutamate or NMDA at the extracellular ligand-binding domain formed by the N1-N2/N3 heterodimers. NMDA mimicks the action of glutamate, specifically binds to GluN2 subunits and regulates the NMDA-type iGlu receptors only. Polyamines act as allosteric modulators by binding to the extracellular n-terminal domain (NTD). Zn2+ acts as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to the bilobed cleft of the NTD. H+ also acts as an allosteric inhibitor but its binding site remains uncertain. Mg2+ binds the "GluN2 S/L site" of the transmembrane domain.

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and low extracellular pH and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception.

Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell.

The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections.

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes.. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission. CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes.	Monomers of ESCRT-III components take on a closed, self-inhibitory conformation. They are soluble owning to their N-terminal basic and C-terminal acidic regions that form tightly packed, helical hairpins. Structural studies suggest all ESCRT-III subunits are likely to adopt the 4-helix bundle configuration, with a fifth helix connected by a highly flexible linker. Subunits CHMP3 and CHMP6 facilitate anchorage of ESCRT-III to the membrane via the interaction of CHMP3 with phosphatidylinositol phosphate, releasing the conformational inhibition and allowing the complex to assemble into higher-order structures.	-	-	Neurodegenerative disease [EFO:0005772]: A disorder of the central nervous system characterized by gradual and progressive loss of neural tissue and neurological function.

Phosphorylates Rb at Ser-807 and Ser-811, resulting in activation of E2F transcription factors which causes induction of transcription and transition from G0 to G1 of the cell cycle. However, most laboratory mouse strains are naturally deficient in CDK3 suggesting this activity is redundant to that of CDK1 and CDK2. Cyclin-C-CDK3 also phosphorylates the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 leading to its SCF-Fbw7-dependent ubiquitination and proteasome-driven degradation, thus potentially playing a role in self-renewal and differentiation of multiple cell types.

Required for the dissociation and recycling of ESCRT-III complex (CPX-329) subunits from vesicle and plasma membranes as well as the midbody during the final stages of cytokinesis where it causes constriction of the ESCRT-III polymer and fission of the associated membrane neck. Multiple disassembly reactions are performed until ESCRT-III dissociation has been completed. VPS4 ATPase activity is regulated by a) ESCRT-III interactions with VPS4 which enhance ATP hydrolysis by relieving autoinhibition of the AAA domain and b) binding of the VTA1 homodimers (Q9NP79) which both promotes VPS4 oligomerization and enhances ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ESCRT-III subunits CHMP1B (Q7LBR1) or CHMP5 (Q9NZZ3) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis. Binding of IST1 (P53990) to VPS4 negatively regulates VPS4 activity by blocking binding to the ESCRT machinery.
