981238139	rs11849538		estradiol	22405131	Other	yes	"3 transfected (with a pcDNA4.1-ERalpha construct) LCLs were used which also had ""variant"" alleles for rs7158782, rs7159713, and rs2369049. Alleles were not mentioned specifically but were listed only as ""variant"" and ""wt"". dbSNP has G as the minor allele in Europeans so variant was understood to = G, but this is not completely clear due to possibility of strand switch. Several increasing concentrations of estradiol were used - stated to be in the range found in plasma of post-menopausal women."
