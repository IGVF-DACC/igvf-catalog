Sequencing revealed that he had one allele *3A and one allele *2 (note that this paper named the allele *3, but the TPMT nomenclature committee now has it as *3A). The *3A allele is composed of two SNPs: rs1800460 and rs1142345. Each SNP was analyzed separately for its effect on the TPMT protein. The variant T allele on rs1800460 resulted in 4-fold less TPMT protein levels and 9-fold less TPMT catalytic activity compared to the wild-type C allele. It also resulted in a 13-fold lower intrinsic clearance of 6-mercaptopurine (i.e. Vmax/Km). Please note that alleles have been complemented to the plus chromosomal strand.

1444667615	rs4880	SOD2	methotrexate	25330300	Toxicity	yes	PBMCs were obtained from healthy volunteers and response to methotrexate (MTX) was assessed by genotype. The G allele was associated with a decreased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX (little change in cell proliferation or cell viability upon exposure to MTX). At increasing MTX concentration the GG genotype was also associated with decreased SOD2 protein activity and increased SOD2 gene expression.  The ratio of anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic gene expression (BAX/Bcl2) was lowest in cells with the AG and GG genotype and highest in the AA genotype cells, indicating that the  AA genotype had an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX. Markers of oxidative stress (gene expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation and ROS levels) were also observed. DNA damage did not differ significantly between groups. The GG genotype showed evidence of decreased oxidative stress upon exposure to MTX. Note: the authors refer to this polymorphism (rs4880) as Ala16Val and each allele as A for alanine or V for valine. The correct AA change is Val16Ala and A>G. Therefore the genotypes in this annotation were determined by the amino acid change that was stated in the study (e.g. in the study the V allele is listed here as the A allele and the A allele is listed here as the G allele).

The combination of *2A and *5 on the same allele is referred to as DPYD*2B, however, the authors did not comment on whether these were on the same or different alleles. *2A refers to rs3918290, which is a splicing variant that leads to a no function allele. *5 refers to rs1801159, which results in I543V and is assigned as a normal function allele. This patient had low DPYD activity, at 84.5 pmol/min/mg protein in the initial sample and 126 pmol/min/mg protein in a second sample.

The authors state that the high frequency of mutations at codon 543 and the large range of DPD enzyme activity (44.1-335.4 pmol/min/mg) suggest that this is a common polymorphism and is not itself associated with low enzyme activity. Note that the mean DPD activity for the entire patient population was 210 pmol/min/mg; the authors comment that a cut-off value for suspected heterozygous DPD deficiency has been suggested at 100 pmol/min/mg, though <60 pmol/min/mg (below lower limit of the 95% distribution range) perhaps should be considered.
